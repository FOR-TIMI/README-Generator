* when a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README
* when a user enters my project title, it is displayed as the title of the README
* when a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, the information is added to their appropriate sections
* when a user chooses a license for my application from a list of options a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under
* when a user enter's their GitHub username, it is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
